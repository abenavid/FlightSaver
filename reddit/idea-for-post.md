**Title:**  
💰 PSA: If You’ve Booked a Flight, You Might Be Overpaying Without Knowing It  

**Body:**  

Most people don’t realize this, but **airlines constantly change prices**—and in many cases, they allow you to **cancel and rebook at the lower fare without any penalty**.  

The problem? **Airlines won’t notify you when the price drops.**  

### **How This Works:**  
- You book a flight for **$500**.  
- A few weeks later, the price drops to **$400**.  
- If the airline allows free rebooking (like Southwest, JetBlue, and Alaska), you can **cancel and rebook at the lower fare—saving $100 instantly**.  
- But who has time to check flight prices every day?  

That’s why I built **[FlightSaver](https://abenavid.github.io/FlightSaver)**—a simple tool that **tracks your booked flight prices** and alerts you when a price drop happens so you can rebook and save money.  

### **Why Airlines Hope You Never Do This:**  
✅ **They expect you to “set it and forget it” after booking.**  
✅ **They won’t remind you to check for lower prices.**  
✅ **Most people never go back to see if they can save money.**  

Some airlines, like **Southwest**, even **give you airline credit for the difference**—so this works even if you’re not canceling outright.  

I’m launching FlightSaver soon—if you want to be one of the first to try it, **sign up for free here:**

Has anyone here done this manually before? How much did you save?
