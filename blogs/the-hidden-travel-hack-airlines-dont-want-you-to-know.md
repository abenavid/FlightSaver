# The Hidden Travel Hack Airlines Donâ€™t Want You to Know  

Most people think once theyâ€™ve booked a flight, thatâ€™s the price theyâ€™re stuck with. **But what if you could rebook the same flight for lessâ€”without paying a penalty?**  

Airlines change prices **constantly**, and in many cases, they allow you to **cancel and rebook at the lower fare**. The problem? Almost no one takes advantage of this because they donâ€™t have time to monitor flight prices 24/7.  

## **The Secret to Getting Cheaper Flights After Booking**  

Letâ€™s say you book a flight for **$500** today. A few weeks later, the airline drops the price to **$400**â€”but you wouldnâ€™t know unless you were checking manually.  

This happens **all the time**, and airlines **arenâ€™t going to tell you** when you could rebook for a cheaper price.  

Thatâ€™s where **[FlightSaver](https://abenavid.github.io/FlightSaver)** comes in.  

## **How FlightSaver Works**

âœ… **FlightSaver tracks price drops** in real time  
âœ… **Get an instant alert** if the price drops below what you paid  
âœ… **Rebook & save money** with no extra effort

- You book a Southwest flight for **$350** today.  
- A month later, it drops to **$270**.  
- FlightSaver alerts you â†’ You rebook â†’ You save **$80 instantly**.  

## **Why Airlines Hope You Donâ€™t Use This Trick**  

1. **Most travelers never check prices again after booking.**  
2. **Airlines wonâ€™t notify you about cheaper pricesâ€”you have to find them.**
