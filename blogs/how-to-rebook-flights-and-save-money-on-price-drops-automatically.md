# How to Rebook Flights and Save Money on Price Drops (Automatically)

Have you ever booked a flight, only to check back later and see the price drop? Youâ€™re not alone. Airlines frequently adjust fares, and savvy travelers know that some allow **free cancellations and rebooking at a lower price**â€”but tracking those price drops manually is a hassle.  

## Introducing FlightSaver: Never Overpay for a Flight Again  

Thatâ€™s where **[FlightSaver](https://abenavid.github.io/FlightSaver)** comes in. Itâ€™s a simple tool designed to monitor the price of flights youâ€™ve already booked. If the fare drops below what you originally paid, youâ€™ll get an alertâ€”so you can **cancel and rebook at the lower price, keeping the savings in your pocket**.  

ðŸ’° **Example:**  
You book a Southwest flight for **$500** in January. A month later, the price drops to **$400**. FlightSaver alerts you, and you rebook, saving **$100 instantly**â€”all without doing any manual tracking.  

## How It Works  
1. **Enter Your Flight Details** â€“ Add your airline, travel dates, and what you paid.  
2. **FlightSaver Tracks the Price** â€“ We check fares automatically.  
3. **Get an Alert When Prices Drop** â€“ If a rebooking opportunity appears, youâ€™ll get an email or SMS.  
4. **Rebook & Save** â€“ Follow the airlineâ€™s cancellation policy to get the lower fare.  

## Why This Matters  
- **Many airlines (like Southwest) let you rebook for free**, giving you **airline credits or refunds** for the price difference.  
- Most people donâ€™t track flight prices after booking, missing out on easy savings.  
- Automation means **zero effort** on your partâ€”FlightSaver does the work for you.
